eKonobar is a mobile app built using React, Tailwind, and ViteJS, and integrated with Firebase's Firestore database and Storage service. Firestore manages data related to orders and reservations, while Firebase Storage handles menu item image uploads. These services enable real-time updates and efficient data management.

This project involves developing a mobile application for a local restaurant. The app aims to enhance the customer experience by providing easy access to the menu, ordering system, and reservation management. It also includes an admin panel for restaurant staff to manage orders, reservations, and menu items.

The app is currently in development, with some of its features still not functional. Users can log in using the provided link, which takes them to a user interface where they can browse the menu and place orders. The admin login link provides access to the admin panel, which requires a username and password to log in.

The admin panel allows staff members to manage orders, view customer feedback in near future, and update the menu. The app's goal is to simplify the restaurant's operations by streamlining the ordering and reservation process, as well as providing valuable insights into customer preferences.

Overall, this project has the potential to benefit both the restaurant and its customers by creating a more efficient and user-friendly system. With ongoing development, it is expected to become a valuable asset to the restaurant's operations.
